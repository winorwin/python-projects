I started learning python seriously about 5 days ago, around July 03rd 2019. This date is important to help me keep track of my progress.

My learning strategy so far is to read the tutorial material on the official python website. Then, as soon as I have the sufficient knowledge, to start challenging myself with some projects. A project can be as simple as determine whether a given number is prime or not. And as I am getting into more advanced topics, I will undertake more challenging projects.

My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer or developer. The difference between those two for me is still kinda blurry. But I guess I'll figure it out later on.

Please feel free to showcase any mistake or if you know a better alternative to any of my code, please just say it.

Thanks!
